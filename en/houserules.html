                            accommodation or use of the facility. Please note that the facility will not be responsible

                            guests' property or safety that is not the responsibility of the facility. In the event of

                                        indoor slippers to maintain cleanliness.</li>
                                    <li>(2) Evacuation can be done through the 1st-floor entrance and windows of

                                        a penalty of 50,000 yen.</li>
