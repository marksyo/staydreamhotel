                            house rules to
                            ensure the safety and comfort of our guests. If these rules are not followed, we reserve the
                            right to refuse
                            accommodation or use of the facility. Please note that the facility will not be responsible
                            for the loss of
                            guests' property or safety that is not the responsibility of the facility. In the event of
                            facility
                            unavailability due to natural disasters, disasters, incidents, or equipment failures, we
                            will refund the
                            charges for the unusable days, but we will not compensate for other losses (such as

                                <ul>
                                    <li>(1) No shoes allowed inside the facility, except on balconies. Please do not go
                                        outside wearing indoor
                                        slippers to maintain cleanliness.</li>
                                    <li>(2) Evacuation can be done through the 1st-floor entrance and windows of
                                        1st-floor rooms.</li>
                                    <li>(3) Always lock the door when in the room or especially during sleep.</li>
                                    <li>(4) The entire facility, including balconies, is non-smoking. Smoking inside the
                                        facility incurs a
                                        penalty of 50,000 yen.<br>
                                        ※ If smoking is discovered inside the facility, a penalty of 50,000 yen will be
                                        charged.<br></li>
                                    <li>(5) Accommodate only the number of guests reserved. Unauthorized guests,
                                        different numbers of guests, or
                                        stays are prohibited.<br>
                                        ※ In case of exceeding the reserved number of guests, false reservations, or
                                        stays by unauthorized
                                        guests, a penalty of 15,000 yen per person per night may be charged.<br></li>
                                    <li>(6) The facility's contracted amperage is a maximum of 60A. The maximum amperage
                                        for a single electrical
                                        outlet is 15A. Proper electrical usage is essential to avoid power outages.<br>
                                        Improper use of electricity may lead to power outages. Examples of improper
                                        electricity usage include
                                        using air conditioning with room or windows open, using electrical equipment
                                        that generates a large
                                        current on a single outlet, etc.<br>
                                        When excessive current is detected, the power will automatically cut off for 10
                                        seconds. If the
                                        electricity usage is not improved, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) will
                                        automatically cut off the
                                        power.<br>
                                        Details can be found on TEPCO's website: <a

                                    <li>(7) Close all windows and doors throughout the facility before going out to
                                        prevent rain from entering
